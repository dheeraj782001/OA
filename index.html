            <div class="text">
                <p class="txt"> Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. </p>

            <div class="text">
                 <p class="txt">Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.
                Aristotle has been called "the father of logic", "the father of biology", "the father of political science", "the father of zoology", "the father of embryology", "the father of natural law", "the father of scientific method", "the father of rhetoric", "the father of psychology", "the father of realism", "the father of criticism", "the father of individualism", "the father of teleology", and "the father of meteorology".</p>

                    <h2>Physics</h2>
                    <p>In his On Generation and Corruption, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly Aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planet</p>

                    <h2>Logic</h2>
                    <p>With the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,[28] and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic.[29] Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that with Aristotle logic reached its completion</p>

                    <h2>Nicomachean Ethics</h2>
                    <p>Based on notes from his lectures in the Lyceum, Aristotle posits happiness (eudaimonia) or ‘living well’ as the primary goal in human life. Named for his son, Nicomachus, the Ethics considers how man should best live and those virtues which produce happiness. Aristotle argues that man does not need to act to commit a crime: omitting to do something can be just as unethical.</p>

                    <h2>Politics</h2>
                    <p>When describing man as a ‘political animal’, Aristotle argues that the polis – or city state – is humanity’s natural habitat. Politics, meaning ‘things concerning the polis’, explores the best ways that man might live in society and describes how royalty, aristocracy and constitutional government corrupt to become tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. For Aristotle, different species have naturally occurring and fixed characteristics.</p>

                    <h2>Metaphysics</h2>
                    <p>Meaning ‘after the physics’, Aristotle’s study is the first work to bear the title, though Aristotle himself did not use the term and it is thought to have been added in the first century. Aristotle describes the work as ‘the study of being qua being’ or the ‘first philosophy’, in which the author examines the nature of ‘things that can be said to be’.</p>

                    <h2>On the Soul (De Anima)</h2>
                    <p>Written coterminously with significant developments in scientific thought, logic and biology, in De Anima Aristotle attempts to understand the soul, hoping to define its essential nature and properties, a task he describes as ‘one of the most difficult things in the world’. To do so, he discusses the souls of different kinds of living things: plants, lower animals and humans.</p>
